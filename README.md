# Zotero NASA ADS Metadata Updater

This Zotero plugin allows one to update the Zotero metadata and/or download a publisher PDF for a given paper based on a query to the [SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) database. Note that one requires a ADS API Key (see [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/)) to perform the query.

Issues: currently, the PDF retrieval does not work in many cases due to hitting a Captcha.
